 PICO-8 is built with:
 	SDL2 http://www.libsdl.org
 	Lua 5.2 http://www.lua.org  // see license.txt
 	GIFLIB http://giflib.sourceforge.net/
 	WiringPi http://wiringpi.com/

============================================================================================

Welcome to PICO-8!

	PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer 
	programs. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua programs 
	and provides simple built-in tools for creating sprites, maps and sound.

	The harsh limitations of PICO-8 are carefully chosen to be fun to work with, encourage small
	but expressive designs and hopefully to give PICO-8 cartridges their own particular look and 
	feel.


:: Keys

	Toggle Fullscreen: Alt+Enter 
	Quit: Alt+F4 or command-Q
	Reload/Run/Restart cart: Ctrl+R
	Quick-Save: Ctrl+S
	Mute/Unmute: Ctrl+M
	Player 1 defaults: Cursors + ZX / NM / CV
	Player 2 defaults: SDFE + tab,Q / shift A
	Enter or P for pause menu (while running)
	// use KEYCONFIG to change the defaults.
	

:: Specs

	Display: 128x128, fixed 16 colour palette
	Input: 6-button controllers
	Cartridge size: 32k
	Sound: 4 channel, 64 definable chip blerps
	Code: Lua (max 8192 tokens of code) 
	Sprites: Single bank of 128 8x8 sprites (+128 shared)
	Map: 128x32 8-bit cels (+128x32 shared)


:: Hello World

	After PICO-8 boots, try typing some of these commands followed by enter:

		PRINT("HELLO WORLD")
		RECTFILL(80,80,120,100,12)
		CIRCFILL(70,90,20,14)
		FOR I=1,4 DO PRINT(I) END
	
	(Note: PICO-8 only displays upper-case characters -- just type normally without capslock!)
	
	You can build up an interactive program by using commands like this in the code editing
	mode along with two special callback functions _UPDATE and _DRAW. For example, the following
	program allows you to move a circle around with the cursor keys. Press escape to switch
	to the code editor and type or copy & paste the following code:

	X = 64  Y = 64
	FUNCTION _UPDATE()
	 IF (BTN(0)) THEN X=X-1 END
	 IF (BTN(1)) THEN X=X+1 END
	 IF (BTN(2)) THEN Y=Y-1 END
	 IF (BTN(3)) THEN Y=Y+1 END
	END

	FUNCTION _DRAW()
	 RECTFILL(0,0,127,127,5)
	 CIRCFILL(X,Y,7,14)
	END

	Now press escape to return to the console and type RUN (or press CTRL-R) to see it 
	in action. See the example cartridges for more complex programs.
	
	If you want to store your program for later, use the SAVE command:
	
	> SAVE PINKCIRC
	
	And load it again:
	
	> LOAD PINKCIRC
	

:: Example Cartridges

	These cartridges are included with PICO-8 and can be installed by typing:
	
	INSTALL_DEMOS
	CD DEMOS
	
	HELLO      Greetings from PICO-8
	API        Demonstrates most PICO-8 functions
	JELPI      Platform game demo w/ 2p support 
	CAST       2.5D Raycaster demo
	MANDEL     Mandelbrot explorer
	COLLIDE    Example wall and actor collisions
	BUTTERFLY  Serpinsky triangles thing
	DRIPPY     Draw a drippy squiggle
	STOMPY     Music cart

	To run a cartridge, open PICO-8 and type:

	LOAD JELPI
	RUN
	
	Press escape to stop the program, and once more to enter editing mode.


:: File System

	These commands can be used to manage files and directories (folders):
	
	DIR         list the current directory
	CD BLAH     change directory
	CD ..       go up a directory
	CD /        change back to top directory (on PICO-8's virtual drive)
	MKDIR BLAH  make a directory
	FOLDER      open the current directory in the host operating system's file browser

	LOAD BLAH  load a cart from the current directory
	SAVE BLAH  save a cart to the current directory
	
	If you want to move files around, duplicate them or delete them, use the FOLDER 
	command and do it in the host operating system.
	
	The default location for PICO-8's drive is:
	
	Windows: C:/Users/Yourname/AppData/Roaming/pico-8/carts
	OSX: /Users/Yourname/Library/Application Support/pico-8/carts
	Linux: ~/.lexaloffle/pico-8/carts

	You can change this and other settings in pico-8/config.txt
	
	Tip: The drive directory can be mapped to a cloud drive (provided by Dropbox, Google
	Drive or similar) in order to provide a single disk shared between PICO-8 machines 
	spread across different host machines.


:: Loading and Saving

	When using LOAD and SAVE, the .P8 extention can be omitted and is added automatically.
		
	Saving to a .p8.png extention will save the cartridge in a special image format that
	looks like a cartridge.
	
	Use a filename of "@CLIP" to load or save to the clipboard.

	Once a cartridge has been loaded or saved, it can also be quick-saved with CTRL-S

	:: Saving .p8.png carts with a text label and preview image
	
		To generate a label image saved with the cart, run the program first and press F7 to grab
		whatever is on the screen. The first two lines of the program starting with '--' are also 
		drawn to the cart's label.

		e.g.
		-- OCEAN DIVER LEGENDS
		-- BY LOOPY
	

	:: Code size restrictions for .png format
	
		When saving in .png format, the compressed size of the code must be less than 15360 bytes.
		To find out the current size of your code, use the INFO command. The compressed size limit 
		is not enforced for saving in .p8 format.
		

:: Using an External Text Editor

	It is possible to edit .p8 files directly with a separate text editor. Using CTRL-R to run a
	cartridge will automatically re-load the file if:
	
		1. There are no unsaved changes in the PICO-8 editors, AND
		2. The file differs in content from the last loaded version
		
	If there are changes to the cart on disk /and/ in the editor, a notification is displayed:
	
		DIDN'T RELOAD; UNSAVED CHANGES
	
	PICO-8 does not fully support upper-case characters, and they are automatically converted to
	lower-case when viewed in the code editor. Note that this also causes unsaved changes to exist, 
	which means that CTRL-R will stop automatically re-loading the version on disk until it is
	manually LOAD()ed.
	
	Glyph characters (normally typed with shift-A..Z) are stored in .p8 format and in the
	host operating system's clipboard as rough unicode equivalents. 
	

:: Backups

	If you quit without saving changes, or overwrite an existing file, a backup of the 
	cartridge is saved to {appdata}/pico-8/backup.
	

:: Configuration

	:: config.txt
	
		You can find some settings in config.txt. Edit the file when PICO-8 is not running.
	
		Windows: C:/Users/Yourname/AppData/Roaming/pico-8/config.txt
		OSX: /Users/Yourname/Library/Application Support/pico-8/config.txt
		Linux: ~/.lexaloffle/pico-8/config.txt

		Use the -home switch (below) to use a different path to store config.txt and other data.
		

	:: Commandline parameters
	
		// note: these override settings found in config.txt
		
		pico-8 [switches] [filename.p8]
		
		-width n                 set the window width 
		-height n                set the window height 
		-windowed n              set windowed mode off (0) or on (1)
		-sound n                 sound volume 0..256

		-pixel_perfect n         1 for unfiltered screen stretching at integer scales (on by default)
		-draw_rect x,y,w,h       absolute window coordinates and size to draw pico-8's screen 
		-run filename            load and run a cartridge
		-x filename              execute a PICO-8 cart headless and then quit
		-p param_str             pass a parameter string to the specified cartridge

		-home path               set the path to store config.txt and other user data files
		-desktop path            set a location for screenshots and gifs to be saved
		-screenshot_scale n      scale of screenshots.  default: 3 (368x368 pixels)
		-gif_scale n             scale of gif captures. default: 2 (256x256 pixels)
		-gif_len n               set the maximum gif length in seconds (1..120)
		-gui_theme n             use 1 for a higher contrast editor colour scheme
		-timeout n               how many seconds to wait before downloads timeout (default: 30)
		-software_blit n         use software blitting mode off (0) or on (1)
		-foreground_sleep_ms n   how many milliseconds to sleep between frames.
		-background_sleep_ms n   how many milliseconds to sleep between frames when running in background


:: Controller Setup

	PICO-8 uses the SDL2 controller configuration scheme. It will detect common controllers
	on startup and also looks for custom mappings in sdl_controllers.txt in the same directory 
	as config.txt. sdl_controllers.txt has one mapping per line.

	To generate a custom mapping string for your controller, use either the controllermap
	program that comes with SDL2, or try http://www.generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/

	To set up which keyboard keys trigger joystick buttons presses, use KEYCONFIG.



:: Screenshots, Videos and Cartridge Labels

	While a cartridge is running use:

		F6 Save a screenshot to desktop
		F7 Capture cartridge label image
		F8 Start recording a video
		F9 Save GIF video to desktop (max: 8 seconds by default)
		
		// if F6..F9 are not available on your system, use CTRL-6..9
	
	You can save a video at any time (it is always recording) -- use F8 just to reset
	the video starting point if you want something less than 8 seconds long.

	To change the maximum gif length, edit gif_len in config.txt to specify the number
	of seconds to record for. The gif format can not match 30fps exactly, so PICO-8 
	instead uses the closest match: 33.3fps.
	
	

:: Sharing Cartridges

	There are three ways to share carts made in PICO-8:
	
		1. Share the .p8 or .p8.png file directly with other PICO-8 users
		
			Type FOLDER to open the current folder in your host operating system.
	
		2. Post the cart on the Lexaloffe BBS to get a web-playable version

			http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=submit
			
		3. Export the cartridge to a stand-alone html/js or native binary player
			(see the exporters section for details)
		
		
:: Exporters / Importers

	The EXPORT command can be used to generate png, wav files and stand-alone html and native
	binary cartridge players. The output format is inferred from the filename extention (e.g.
	.png).
	
	You are free to distribute and use exported cartridges and data as you please, provided 
	that you have permission from the author and contributors.

	:: Sprite Sheet (.png)
	
		IMPORT BLAH.PNG     --  expects 128x128 png and colour-fits to the pico-8 palette
		EXPORT BLAH.PNG     --  use folder() to locate the exported png
	
	:: SFX and Music (.wav)
	
		EXPORT BLAH.WAV     --  export music from the current pattern (when editor mode is MUSIC)
		EXPORT BLAH.WAV     --  export the current SFX (when editor mode is SFX)
		EXPORT BLAH%D.WAV   --  exports all of the SFXs as blah0.wav, blah1.wav .. blah63.wav

	:: HTML Player (.html)
	
		To generate a stand-alone html player (foo.html and foo.js):
		> EXPORT FOO.HTML
		
		Or just the .js file:
		> EXPORT FOO.JS
		
		Optionally provide a custom html template with the -p switch:
		> EXPORT FOO.HTML -P ONE_BUTTON
		
		This will use the file {application data}/pico-8/plates/one_button.html as the
		html shell, replacing a special string, ##js_file##, with the .js filename.
		
	
	:: Binary Player (.bin)
	
		To generate stand-alone executables for Windows, Linux (64-bit) and Mac OSX:
		
		> EXPORT FOO.BIN
		
		By default, the cartridge label is used as an icon with no transparency. To 
		specificy an icon from the sprite sheet, use -i and optionally -s and/or -c 
		to control the size and transparency.
		
			-I N  Icon index N with a default transparent colour of 0 (black).
			-S N  Size NxN sprites. Size 3 would be produce a 24x24 icon.
			-C N  Treat colour N as transparent. Use 16 for no transparency.

		For example, to use a 2x2 sprite starting at index 32 in the spritesheet, 
		using colour 12 as transparent, and bundling an extra cartrige C0.P8:
		
			> EXPORT FOO.BIN -I 32 -S 2 -C 12 C0.P8

	
:: Exporting Multiple Cartridges

	Up to 16 cartridges can be bundled together by passing them to EXPORT, when generating
	stand-alone html or native binary players
	
	EXPORT FOO.HTML DAT1.P8 DAT2.P8 GAME2.P8
	
	During runtime, the extra carts can be accessed as if they were local files:
	
	RELOAD(0,0,0x2000, "DAT1.P8") -- load spritesheet from DAT1.P8
	LOAD("GAME2.P8") -- load and run another cart
	

:: Splore

	SPLORE is a built-in utility for browsing and organising both local and bbs (online)
	cartridges. Type SPLORE [enter] to launch it, or launch PICO-8 with -splore. 
	
	It is possible to control SPLORE entirely with a joystick:
	LEFT and RIGHT to navigate lists of cartridges
	UP AND DOWN to select items in each list
	X,O or MENU to launch the cartridge
	
	While inside a cart, press MENU to favourite a cartridge or exit to splore.
	If you're using a keyboard, it's also possible to press F to favourite an item
	while it is selected in the cartridge list view.
	
	When viewing a list of BBS carts, use the top list item to re-download a list of
	cartridges. If you are offline, the last downloaded list is displayed, and it is
	still possible to play any cartridges you have downloaded.
	
	If you have installed PICO-8 on a machine with no internet access, you can also
	use INSTALL_GAMES to add a small selection of pre-installed BBS carts to your
	favourites list.
	


:: Quirks of PICO-8

	Common gotchas to watch out for:
	
	- The bottom half of the spritesheet and bottom half of the map occupy the same memory.
		// Best use only one or the other if you're unsure how this works.
	- PICO-8 numbers only go up to 32767.99.
		// If you add 1 to a counter each frame, it will overflow after around 18 minutes!
	- Lua arrays are 1-based by default, not 0-based. FOREACH starts at T[1], not T[0].
	- cos() and sin() take 0..1 instead of 0..PI*2, and sin() is inverted.
	- sgn(0) returns 1.
	- Toggle fullscreen: use alt-enter on OSX (command-F is used for searching text).
	- When you want to export a .png cartridge, use SAVE, not EXPORT. EXPORT will save only the spritesheet!



============================================================================================
	Editor Modes
============================================================================================
	
	Press escape to toggle between console and editor
	Click editing mode tabs at top right to switch or press ALT+LEFT/RIGHT


	** WARNING: The second half of the sprite sheet (banks 2 and 3), and the bottom half
	of the map share the same cartridge space. It's up to you how you use the data, but
	be aware that drawing on the second half of the sprite sheet could clobber data on
	the map and vice versa.
	

:: Code Editor
	
	Hold shift to select (or click and drag with mouse)
	CTRL-X, C, V to cut copy or paste selected
	CTRL-Z, Y to undo, redo
	CTRL-F to search for text in the current tab
	CTRL-G to repeat the last search again
	CTRL-L to jump to a line number
	CTRL-UP, DOWN to jump to start or end
	ALT-UP, DOWN to navigate to the previous, next function
	CTRL-LEFT, RIGHT to jump by word
	CTRL-D to duplicate current line
	TAB to indent a selection (shift to un-indent)

	To enter special characters that represent buttons, use SHIFT-L,R,U,D,O,X
	Or press CTRL-K to toggle glyph mode
	
	:: Tabs
	
		Click the [+] button at the top to add a new tab.
		Navigate tabs by left-clicking, or with ctrl-tab, shift-ctrl-tab.
		To remove the last tab, delete any contents and then moving off it (CTRL-A, del, ctrl-tab)
		When running a cart, a single program is generated by concatenating all tabs in order.
	
	:: Code limits
	
		The current number of code tokens is shown at the bottom right. One program can have a
		maximum of 8192 tokens. Each token is a word (e.g. variable name) or operator. Pairs of
		brackets, and strings each count as 1 token. commas, periods, LOCALs, semi-colons, ENDs,
		and comments are not counted.
		
		Right click to toggle through other stats (character count, compressed size).
		If a limit is reached, a warning light will flash. This can be disabled by right-clicking.


:: Sprite Editor

	The sprite editor is designed to be used both for sprite-wise editing and for freeform 
	pixel-level editing. The sprite navigator at the bottom of the screen provides an 8x8-wise 
	view into the sprite-sheet, but it is possible to use freeform tools (pan, select) when
	dealing with larger or oddly sized areas.

	Draw Tool
		Click and drag on the sprite to plot pixels
		Applies to visible area
		Hold CTRL to search and replace a colour
		Use right mouse button to select colour

	Stamp Tool
		Click to stamp whatever is in the copy buffer
		Hold LCONTROL to treat colour 0 (black) as transparent 

	Select Tool // shortcut: LSHIFT or S
		Create a selection
		Enter or click to select none.
		
		If a pixel-wise selection is not present, many operations are instead applied
		to a sprite-wise selection. To select sprites, shift-drag in the sprite navigator.
	
	Pan Tool // shortcut: space
		View the spritesheet.
	
	Fill Tool
		Fill with the current colour
		Applies to the current selection
		If no selection, applies to visible area

	Extra keys
		CTRL-Z to undo // single step only in 0.2.0
		CTRL-C to copy selected area or selected sprites
		CTRL-V to paste to current sprite location
		Q,W to switch to previous/next sprite
		1,2 to switch to previous/next colour
		Tab to toggle fullscreen view
		Mousewheel or < and > to zoom (centered in fullscreen)
		
	
	Operations on selected area or selected sprites:
		f to flip
		v to flip vertically
		r to rotate (must be square selection)
		Cursor keys to move (loops if sprite selection)
		
	Sprite flags
		The 8 coloured circles are sprite flags for the current sprite.
		Each one can be true (on) or false (off), and are accessed by
		using the FSET and FGET functions. They are indexed from 0, from
		the left (0,1,2..7). See fset() for more information.
	

:: Map Editor

	The pico-8 map is a 128x32 (or 128x64 using shared space) block of 8-bit values.
	Each value is shown in the editor as a reference to a sprite (0..255), but you can
	of course use the data to represent whatever you like.

	The tools are similar to the ones used in sprite editing mode. Select a sprite
	and click and drag to paint values into the map.	

	To draw multiple sprites, select from sprite navigator with shift+drag
	To copy a block of values, use the selection tool and then stamp tool to paste
	To pan around the map, use the pan tool or hold space
	Q,W to switch to previous/next sprite
	Mousewheel or < and > to zoom (centered in fullscreen)
	

:: SFX Editor

	There are 64 SFX ("sound effects") in a cartridge, used for both sound and music.
	
	Each SFX has 32 notes, and each note has:
		A frequency   (C0..C5)
		An instrument (0..7)
		A volume      (0..7)
		An effect     (0..7)
	
	Each SFX also has these properties:
	
		A play speed (SPD) : the number of 'ticks' to play each note for.
			// This means that 1 is fastest, 3 is 3x as slow, etc.

		Loop start and end : this is the note index to loop back and to
			// Looping is turned off when the start index >= end index
	
	There are 2 modes for editing/viewing a SFX: Pitch mode (more suitable
	for sound effects) and tracker mode (more suitable for music). The mode
	can be changed using the top-left buttons, or toggled with TAB.
	
	
	1. Pitch Mode
	
		Click and drag on the pitch area to set the frequency for each note,
		using the currently selected instrument (indicated by colour).
		
		Hold shift to apply only the selected instrument
		Hold CTRL to snap entered notes to the C minor pentatonic scale
	
	
	2. Tracker Mode
	
		Each note shows: frequency octave instrument volume effect
		To enter a note, use q2w3er5t6y7ui zsxdcvgbhnjm (piano-like layout)
		Hold shift when entering a note to transpose -1 octave .. +1 octave
		New notes are given the selected instrument/effect values
		To delete a note, use backspace or set the volume to 0
		
		Click and then shift-click to select a range that can be copied
		(CTRL-C) and pasted (CTRL-V)
		
		Navigation:
			PAGEUP/DOWN or CTRL-UP/DOWN to skip up or down 4 notes
			HOME/END to jump to the first or last note
			CTRL-LEFT/RIGHT to jump across columns
			
		
	3. Controls for both modes
	
		- + to navigate the current SFX
		< > to change the speed.
		SPACE to play/stop
		SHIFT-SPACE to play from the current SFX quarter (group of 8 notes)
		A to release a looping sample
		Left click or right click to increase / decrease the SPD or LOOP values
			// Hold shift when clicking to increase / decrease by 4
			// Alternatively, click and drag left/right or up/down
		Shift-click an instrument, effect, or volume to apply to all notes.
	
	
	:: Effects

		0 none
		1 slide          //  Slide to the next note and volume
		2 vibrato        //  Rapidly vary the pitch within one quarter-tone
		3 drop           //  Rapidly drop the frequency to very low values
		4 fade in        //  Ramp the volume up from 0
		5 fade out       //  Ramp the volume down to 0
		6 arpeggio fast  //  Iterate over groups of 4 notes at speed of 4
		7 arpeggio slow  //  Iterate over groups of 4 notes at speed of 8
		
		If the SFX speed is <= 8, arpeggio speeds are halved to 2, 4


:: Music Editor

	Music in PICO-8 is controlled by a sequence of 'patterns'. Each pattern is a list of
	4 numbers indicating which SFX will be played on that channel.
	
	
	:: Flow control
	
		Playback flow can be controlled using the 3 buttons at the top right.
	
		When a pattern has finished playing, the next pattern is played unless:
	
		- there is no data left to play (music stops)
		- a STOP command is set on that pattern (the third button)
		- a LOOP BACK command is set (the 2nd button), in which case the music player searches
			back for a pattern with the LOOP START command set (the first button) or returns to
			pattern 0 if none is found.
	
		When a pattern has SFXes with different speeds, the pattern finishes playing when
		the left-most non-looping channel has finished playing. This can be used to set up
		time signatures that don't divide into 32, or double-time drum beats etc.
	
	
	:: Copying music between or within cartridges
	
		To select a range of patterns: click once on the first pattern in the pattern 
		navigator, then shift-click on the last pattern. Selected patterns can be copied 
		and pasted with CTRL-C and CTRL-V. When pasting into another cartridge, the SFX 
		that each pattern points to will also be pasted (possibly with a different index) 
		if it does not already exist.


	:: SFX Instruments

		In addition to the 8 built-in instruments, custom instruments can be defined using 
		the first 8 SFX. Use the toggle button to the right of the instruments to select an 
		index, which will show up in the instrument channel as green instead of pink.

		When an SFX instrument note is played, it essentially triggers that SFX, but alters 
		the note's attributes:

			Pitch is added relative to C2
			Volume is multiplied
			Effects are applied on top of the SFX instrument's effects

		For example, a simple tremolo effect could be implemented by defining an instrument 
		in SFX 0 that rapidly alternates between volume 5 and 2. When using this instrument
		to play a note, the volume can further be altered as usual (via the volume channel
		or using the fade in/out effects). In this way, SFX instruments can be used to control 
		combinations of detailed changes in volume, pitch and texture.

		SFX instruments are only retriggered when the pitch changes, or the previous note
		has zero volume. This is useful for instruments that change more slowly over time.
		For example: a bell that gradually fades out. To invert this behaviour, effect 3
		(normally 'drop') can be used when triggering the note. All other effect values	have 
		their usual meaning when triggering SFX instruments.

	Lua Syntax Primer
============================================================================================

	PICO-8 programs are written using Lua syntax, but do not use the standard Lua library.
	The following is a brief summary of essential Lua syntax.

	For more details, or to find out about proper Lua, see www.lua.org.

	:: Comments

		-- use two hyphens like this to ignore everything until the end of the line
		--[[ multi-line
		comments ]]
	
	
	:: Types and assignment

		Types in Lua are numbers, strings, booleans and tables;

		NUM = 12/100
		S = "THIS IS A STRING"
		B = FALSE
		T = {1,2,3}
	
		Numbers in PICO-8 are all 16:16 fixed point. They range from -32768.0 to 32767.99999
		
		Hexadecimal notation with optional fractional parts can be used:
			0x11        -- 17
			0x11.4000   -- 17.25
	
		Numbers written in decimal are rounded to the closest fixed point value. To see the
		32-bit hexadecimal representation, use PRINT(TOSTR(VAL,TRUE)):
		
			?TOSTR(-32768,TRUE)      -- 0x8000.0000 
			?TOSTR(32767.99999,TRUE) -- 0x7fff.ffff
		
		Dividing by zero evaluates to 0x7fff.ffff if positive, or -0x7fff.ffff if negative.

	:: Tables
	
		In Lua, tables are a collection of key-value pairs where the key and value types can both 
		be mixed. They can be used as arrays by indexing them with integers.

		A={} -- create an empty table
		A[1] = "BLAH"
		A[2] = 42
		A["FOO"] = {1,2,3}

		-- Arrays use 1-based indexing by default
	
		A = {11,12,13,14}
		PRINT(A[2]) -- 12
	
		-- The size of a table indexed with sequential 1-based integers:
	
		PRINT(#A)   -- 4
	
		-- Indexes that are strings can be written using dot notation
	
		PLAYER = {}
		PLAYER.X = 2 -- is equivalent to PLAYER["X"]
		PLAYER.Y = 3

		-- see also the tables section in the api reference below.

	
	:: PICO-8 Shorthand

		PICO-8 also allows several non-standard, shorter ways to write common patterns.
	
		1. IF THEN END statements on a single line can be expressed without the THEN & END
	
		IF (NOT B) I=1 J=2
	
		-- is equivalent to: IF (NOT B) THEN I=1 J=2 END
		-- everything must be written on the same line, and with the condition in brackets
		
	
		2. unary math operators
	
		a += 2  -- equivalent to: a = a + 2
		a -= 2  -- equivalent to: a = a - 2
		a *= 2  -- equivalent to: a = a * 2
		a /= 2  -- equivalent to: a = a / 2
		a %= 2  -- equivalent to: a = a % 2
	
	
		3. != operator
	
		Not shorthand, but pico-8 also accepts != instead of ~= for "not equal to"


============================================================================================
	API
============================================================================================

	PICO-8 is built on the Lua programming language, but does not include the Lua standard library.
	Instead, a small api is offered in keeping with PICO-8's minimal design and limited screen
	space. For an example program that uses most of the api functions, see /DEMOS/API.P8 
	
	Functions are written here as:
	function_name parameter [optional_parameter]

	System functions called from commandline can omit the usual brackets and string quotes:
	load blah.p8 --> load("blah.p8")

	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	load filename [breadcrumb [param_str]]
	save filename
	
		Load or save a cartridge
		
		When loading from a running cartridge, the loaded cartridge is immediately run with
		parameter string param_str, and a menu item is inserted and named breadcrumb, that
		returns the user to the loading cartridge.
		
		Filenames that start with '#' are taken to be a BBS cart followed by its id:
		load("#1234") -- download [and run] cart number 1234
		
		If the id is of the cart's parent post, then the latest version is downloaded.
		BBS carts can be loaded from other BBS carts or local carts, but not from exported carts. 
		
		
	folder
	
		Open the carts folder in the host operating system.

	dir (also aliased as ls)

		List files in the current directory. When called from a running program, returns a list 
		of all .p8 and .p8.png files in the same directory.

	run
	
		Run from the start of the program
		Can be called from inside a program to reset program.

	stop [message]
	
		Stop the cart and optionally print a message

	resume
	
		Run from the existing cart state (flakey)

	reboot
		
		Reboot the machine
		Useful for starting a new project

	info
	
		Print out some information about the cartridge:
		Code size, tokens, compressed size
		
		Also displayed:
		
			UNSAVED CHANGES   When the cartridge in memory differs to the one on disk
			EXTERNAL CHANGES  When the cartridge on disk has changed since it was loaded
				(e.g. by editing the program using a separate text editor)
		
	flip
	
		Flip the back buffer to screen and wait for next frame (30fps)
		Don't normally need to do this -- _draw() calls it for you.
	
		If your program does not call flip before a frame is up, and a _draw() callback
		is not in progress, the current contents of the back buffer are copied to screen.

	printh str [filename] [overwrite]
	
		Print a string to host operating system's console for debugging.
	
		If filename is set, append the string to a file on the host operating system
			// (in the current directory -- use FOLDER to view)
		Setting overwrite to true causes that file to be overwritten rather than appended.
		Use a filename of "@clip" to write to the host's clipboard.
			// use stat(4) to read the clipboard, but the contents of the clipboard are only
			// available after pressing CTRL-V during runtime (for security reasons).

	stat x

		Get system status where x is:

		0  Memory usage (0..2048)
		1  CPU used since last flip (1.0 == 100% CPU at 30fps)
		4  Clipboard contents (after user has pressed CTRL-V)
		6  Parameter string
		7  Current framerate
		
		16..19  Index of currently playing SFX on channels 0..3
		20..23  Note number (0..31) on channel 0..3
		24      Currently playing pattern index
		25      Total patterns played
		26      Ticks played on current pattern

		80..85  UTC time: year, month, day, hour, minute, second
		90..95  Local time

		100     Current breadcrumb label, or nil


	extcmd x
	
		Special system command, where x is a string:
		
			"pause"      request the pause menu be opened
			"reset"      request a cart reset
			"go_back"    follow the current breadcrumb (if there is one)

		Additional commands that are ignored when running as a BBS cart:
		
			"label"      set cart label
			"screen"     save a screenshot
			"rec"        set video start point
			"video"      save a .gif to desktop
			"audio_rec"  start recording audio
			"audio_end"  save recorded audio to desktop

	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Program Structure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	There are 3 special functions that, if defined by the user, are called during program 
	execution:
	
		_update()
			Called once per update at 30fps
	
		_draw()
			Called once per visible frame
		
		_init()
			Called once on program startup


	_draw() is normally called at 30fps, but if it can not complete in time, PICO-8 will
	attempt to run at 15fps and call _update() twice per visible frame to compensate.
	
	
	:: Running PICO-8 at 60fps

		If _update60() is defined instead of _update(), PICO-8 will run in 60fps mode:
	
		- both _update60() and _draw() are called at 60fps
		- half the PICO-8 CPU is available per frame before dropping down to 30fps
		
		Note that not all host machines are capable of running at 60fps. Older machines,
		and / or web versions might also request PICO-8 to run at 30 fps (or 15 fps), even
		when the PICO-8 CPU is not over capacity. In this case, multiple _update60 calls
		are made for every _draw call in the same way.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Graphics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
	PICO-8 has a fixed capacity of 128 8x8 sprites, plus another 128 that overlap with the
	bottom half of the map data ("shared data"). These 256 sprites are collectively called
	the sprite sheet, and can be thought of as a 128x128 pixel image.

	All of PICO-8's drawing operations are subject to the current draw-state. The draw-state
	includes a camera position (for adding an offset to all coordinates), palette mapping 
	(for recolouring sprites), clipping rectangle, a drawing colour, and a fill pattern.
	
	The draw state is reset each time a program is run. This is equivalent to calling:
	clip() camera() pal() color(6)

	Colours indexes:
	
	 0  black   1  dark_blue   2  dark_purple   3  dark_green  
	 4  brown   5  dark_gray   6  light_gray    7  white
	 8  red     9  orange     10  yellow       11  green       
	12  blue   13  indigo     14  pink         15  peach
		

	clip [x y w h]

		Sets the screen's clipping region in pixels
		clip() to reset
	
	
	pget x y
	pset x y [c]

		Get or set the colour (c) of a pixel at x, y.
	
	
	sget x y
	sset x y [c]

		Get or set the colour (c) of a spritesheet pixel.
	
	
	fget n [f]
	fset n [f] v

		Get or set the value (v) of a sprite's flag
		f is the flag index 0..7
		v is boolean and can be true or false
	
		The initial state of flags 0..7 are settable in the sprite editor,
		using the line of little colourful buttons.
	
		The meaning of sprite flags is up to the user, or can be used to
		indicate which group ('layer') of sprites should be drawn by map.

		If the flag index is omitted, all flags are retrieved/set as a bitfield
		fset(2, 1+2+8)   -- sets bits 0,1 and 3
		fset(2, 4, true) -- sets bit 4
		print(fget(2))   -- 27 (1+2+8+16)


	print str [x y [col]]

		Print a string
		If only str is supplied, and the cursor reaches the end of the screen,
		a carriage return and vertical scroll is automatically applied.
		

	cursor x y

		Set the cursor position and carriage return margin


	color col

		Set the default color to be used by drawing functions
	
	
	cls [col]

		Clear the screen and reset the clipping rectangle
		

	camera [x y]

		Set a screen offset of -x, -y for all drawing operations
		camera() to reset
	
	
	circ     x y r [col]
	circfill x y r [col]

		Draw a circle or filled circle at x,y with radius r
		If r is negative, the circle is not drawn

	line x0 y0 x1 y1 [col]

		draw line


	rect     x0 y0 x1 y1 [col]
	rectfill x0 y0 x1 y1 [col]

		Draw a rectangle or filled rectangle
	
	
	pal c0 c1 [p]

		Draw all instances of colour c0 as c1 in subsequent draw calls

		pal() to reset to system defaults (including transparency values and fill pattern)
		
		Two types of palette (p; defaults to 0)
			0 draw palette   : colours are remapped on draw    // e.g. to re-colour sprites
			1 screen palette : colours are remapped on display // e.g. for fades
		c0 colour index 0..15
		c1 colour index to map to
	

	palt c t

		Set transparency for colour index to t (boolean)
		Transparency is observed by spr(), sspr() and map()
		e.g. palt(8, true) -- red pixels not drawn
		palt() resets to default: all colours opaque except colour 0
	


	spr n x y [w h] [flip_x] [flip_y]

		draw sprite n (0..255) at position x,y
		width and height are 1,1 by default and specify how many sprites wide to blit.
		Colour 0 drawn as transparent by default (see palt())
		flip_x=true to flip horizontally
		flip_y=true to flip vertically


	sspr sx sy sw sh dx dy [dw dh] [flip_x] [flip_y]

		Stretch rectangle from sprite sheet (sx, sy, sw, sh) // given in pixels
		and draw in rectangle (dx, dy, dw, dh)
		Colour 0 drawn as transparent by default (see palt())
		dw, dh defaults to sw, sh
		flip_x=true to flip horizontally
		flip_y=true to flip vertically
		

	fillp p
	
		The PICO-8 fill pattern is a 4x4 2-colour tiled pattern observed by:
			circ() circfill() rect() rectfill() pset() line()
		
		p is a bitfield in reading order starting from the highest bit. To calculate the value
		of p for a desired pattern, add the bit values together:
		
			.-----------------------.
			|32768|16384| 8192| 4096|
			|-----|-----|-----|-----|
			| 2048| 1024| 512 | 256 |
			|-----|-----|-----|-----|
			| 128 |  64 |  32 |  16 |
			|-----|-----|-----|-----|
			|  8  |  4  |  2  |  1  |
			'-----------------------'
		
		For example, FILLP(4+8+64+128+  256+512+4096+8192) would create a checkerboard pattern.
		
		This can be more neatly expressed in binary: FILLP(0b0011001111001100)
		The default fill pattern is 0, which means a single solid colour is drawn.
		
		To specify a second colour for the pattern, use the high bits of any colour parameter:
		
			FILLP(0b0011010101101000)
			CIRCFILL(64,64,20, 0x4E) -- brown and pink
		
		An additional bit 0b0.1 can be set to indicate that the second colour is not drawn.
		
			FILLP(0b0011001111001100.1) -- checkboard with transparent squares
		
		The fill pattern can also be set by setting bits in any colour parameter:

			POKE(0x5F34, 1) -- sets integrated fillpattern + colour mode
			CIRCFILL(64,64,20, 0x114E.ABCD) -- sets fill pattern to ABCD

			-- bit  0x1000.0000 means the non-colour bits should be observed
			-- bit  0x0100.0000 transparency bit
			-- bits 0x00FF.0000 are the usual colour bits
			-- bits 0x0000.FFFF are interpreted as the fill pattern
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Tables
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	add t v

		Add value v to the end of table t.
		Equivalent to t[#t+1] = v

			FOO={}        -- create empty table
			ADD(FOO, 11)
			ADD(FOO, 22)
			PRINT(FOO[2]) -- 22

	del t v

		Delete the first instance of value v in table t
		The remaining entries are shifted left one index to avoid holes.
		Note that v is the value of the item to be deleted, not the index into the table!
		del() can be called safely on a table's item while iterating over that table.

			A={1,10,2,11,3,12}
			FOR ITEM IN ALL(A) DO
				IF (ITEM < 10) THEN DEL(A, ITEM) END
			END
			FOREACH(A, PRINT) -- 10,11,12
			PRINT(A[3])       -- 12


	all t

		Used in FOR loops to iterate over all items in a table (that have a 1-based integer index), 
		in the order they were added.
	
			T = {11,12,13};
			ADD(T,14)
			ADD(T,"HI")
			FOR V IN ALL(T) DO PRINT(V) END -- 11 12 13 14 HI
			PRINT(#T) -- 5


	foreach t f

		For each item in table t, call function f with the item as a single parameter.
	
			FOREACH(T, PRINT)


	pairs t

		Used in FOR loops to iterate over table t, providing both the key and value for each item.
		Unlike all(), pairs() iterates over every item regardless of indexing scheme.
		Order is not guaranteed.
	
			T = {["HELLO"]=3, [10]="BLAH"}
			T.BLUE = 5;
			FOR K,V IN PAIRS(T) DO
				PRINT("K: "..K.."  V:"..V)
			END

		Output:
		
			K: 10  v:BLAH
			K: HELLO  v:3
			K: BLUE  v:5


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Input
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	btn [i [p]]

		get button i state for player p (default 0) 
		i: 0..5: left right up down button_o button_x
		p: player index 0..7
	
		If no parameters supplied, returns a bitfield of all 12 button states for player 0 & 1
			// P0: bits 0..5  P1: bits 8..13
	
		Default keyboard mappings to player buttons:
			player 0: cursors, Z,X / C,V / N,M
			player 1: ESDF, LSHIFT,A / TAB,Q,E


	btnp [i [p]]

		btnp is short for "Button Pressed"; Instead of being true when a button is held down, 
		btnp returns true when a button is down AND it was not down the last frame. It also
		repeats after 15 frames, returning true every 4 frames after that (at 30fps -- double
		that at 60fp). This can be used for things like menu navigation or grid-wise player 
		movement.

		

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Audio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	sfx n [channel [offset [length]]]

		play sfx n on channel (0..3) from note offset (0..31) for length notes
		n -1 to stop sound on that channel
		n -2 to release sound on that channel from looping
		Any music playing on the channel will be halted
		offset in number of notes (0..31)
		
		channel -1 (default) to automatically choose a channel that is not being used
		channel -2 to stop the sound from playing on any channel
	
		
	music [n [fade_len [channel_mask]]]

		play music starting from pattern n (0..63)
		n -1 to stop music
		fade_len in ms (default: 0)
		channel_mask specifies which channels to reserve for music only
			e.g. to play on channels 0..2: 1+2+4 = 7
		
		Reserved channels can still be used to play sound effects on, but only when that
		channel index is explicitly requested by sfx().


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Map
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The PICO-8 map is a 128x32 grid of 8-bit cels, or 128x64 when using the shared memory. When 
	using the map editor, the meaning of each cel is taken to be an index into the spritesheet 
	(0..255). However, it can instead be used as a general block of data.
	
	
	mget x y
	mset x y v

		get or set map value (v) at x,y

	map cel_x cel_y sx sy cel_w cel_h [layer]

		draw section of map (in cels) at screen position sx, sy (pixels)
		if layer is specified, only cels with the same flag number set are drawn
			// Bitfield. So 0x5 means draw sprites with bit 0 and bit 2 set.
			// defaults to all sprites
	
		exception: sprite 0 is always taken to mean empty.
	
		e.g. map(0,0, 20,20, 4,2)
		-> draws a 4x2 blocks of cels starting from 0,0 in the map, to the screen at 20,20
		
		If cel_w and cel_h are not specified, defaults to 128,32 
		(the top half of the map -- use 128,64 for the full map including shared memory)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Memory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	PICO-8 has 3 types of memory:

		1. Base RAM (32k): see layout below. Access with peek() poke() memcpy() memset()
		2. Cart ROM (32k): same layout as base ram until 0x4300
		3. Lua RAM (2MB): compiled program + variables

		Technical note: // you probably don't need to know this
		
			While using the editor, the data being modified is in cart rom, but api functions such as spr() 
			and sfx() only operate on base ram. PICO-8 automatically copies cart rom to base ram (i.e.
			calls reload()) in 3 cases:

			1. When a cartridge is loaded
			2. When a cartridge is run
			3. When exiting any of the editor modes


	:: Base ram memory layout
		0x0    gfx
		0x1000 gfx2/map2 (shared)
		0x2000 map
		0x3000 gfx_props
		0x3100 song
		0x3200 sfx
		0x4300 user data
		0x5e00 persistent cart data (256 bytes)
		0x5f00 draw state
		0x5f40 hardware state
		0x5f80 gpio pins (128 bytes)
		0x6000 screen (8k)

		User data has no particular meaning and can be used for anything via memcpy(), peek() & poke().
		Persistent cart data is mapped to 0x5e00..0x5eff but only stored if cartdata() has been called.
		Colour format (gfx/screen) is 2 pixels per byte: low bits encode the left pixel of each pair.
		Map format is one byte per cel, where each byte normally encodes a sprite index.


	peek addr
	poke addr val

		Read and write one byte to an address in base ram.
		Legal addresses are 0x0..0x7fff
		Reading out of range returns 0
		Writing out of range causes a fault
		
	peek4 addr
	poke4 addr val
	
		32-bit versions. Read and write one number (val) in little-endian format.
		addr does not need to be aligned to 4-byte boundaries.

	memcpy dest_addr source_addr len

		Copy len bytes of base ram from source to dest
		Sections can be overlapping

	reload dest_addr source_addr len [filename]

		Same as memcpy, but copies from cart rom
		The code section ( >= 0x4300) is protected and can not be read.
		If filename specified, load data from a different cartridge.
			// (must be local -- bbs cartridges can not be read in this way)

	cstore dest_addr source_addr len [filename]

		Same as memcpy, but copies from base ram to cart rom
		cstore() is equivalent to cstore(0, 0, 0x4300)
		Can use for writing tools to construct carts or to visualize the state 
		of the map / spritesheet using the map editor / gfx editor.
		The code section ( >= 0x4300) is protected and can not be written to.
		
		If a filename is specified, the data is written directly to that
		cartridge on disk. Up to 64 cartridges can be written in one session.
		See the 'Cartridge Data' section for additional notes on using cstore.
		
		
	memset dest_addr val len

		Set len bytes to val
		(quite fast -- can use to draw unclipped horizonal scanlines etc)
	

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Math
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	max x y
	min x y
	mid x y z

		Returns the maximum, minimum, or middle value of parameters
		For example, mid(7,5,10) returns 7

	flr  x
	ceil x

		Returns the closest integer that is equal to or below / above x 
		
		?flr ( 4.1) -->  4
		?ceil( 4.1) -->  5
		?flr (-2.3) --> -3
		?ceil(-2.3) --> -2


	cos x
	sin x

		Returns the cosine of x, where 1.0 indicates a full circle
		sin is inverted to suit screenspace
		e.g. sin(0.25) returns -1

		If you'd prefer radian-based trig functions without the y inversion, 
		paste the following snippet near the start of your program:
	
		cos1 = cos function cos(angle) return cos1(angle/(3.1415*2)) end
		sin1 = sin function sin(angle) return sin1(-angle/(3.1415*2)) end
	

	atan2 dx dy

		Converts dx, dy into an angle from 0..1
		As with cos/sin, angle is taken to run anticlockwise in screenspace
		e.g. atan(1, -1) returns 0.125

	sqrt x

		Return the square root of x
	
	abs x

		Returns the absolute (positive) value of x

	rnd x
		Returns a random number n, where 0 <= n < x
		If you want an integer, use flr(rnd(x))
	
	srand x
		Sets the random number seed
		The seed is automatically randomized on cart startup


	Binary Operations

		band x y
		bor  x y
		bxor x y
		bnot x
		rotl x y
		rotr x y
		shl  x n -- shift left n bits
		shr  x n -- arithmetic right shift
		lshr x n -- logical right shift


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Custom Menu Items
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	menuitem index [label callback]

		Add an extra item to the pause menu
	
		Index should be 1..5 and determines the order each menu item is displayed
		label should be a string up to 16 characters long
		callback is a function called when the item is selected by the users
	
		When no label or function is supplied, the menu item is removed
	
		example:
		menuitem(1, "restart puzzle", function() reset_puzzle() sfx(10) end)
	

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Strings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	s = "the quick brown fox"
	
	-- length
	
		print(#s)          --> 19
	
	
	-- joining strings
		
		print("three "..4) --> "three 4"
	
	
	-- sub() to grab substrings
	
		print(sub(s,5,9))  --> "quick"
		print(sub(s,5))  --> "quick brown fox"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Types
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	type val
	
		returns the name of the type of value x as a string
	
	tostr val [hex]

		returns val as a string
		
		if hex is true and val is a number, an unsigned hexadecimal writing of 
		the number is returned in the format "0x0000.0000". You can use this to
		inspect the internal representation of PICO-8 numbers.
		
		if val is a boolean, it is written as "true" or "false"
		
		all other val types are written as "[typename]"
		
	tonum val
	
		converts val to a number
		if val is a string, the number is taken to be decimal unless prefixed with "0x"
		if the conversion fails, tonum returns no value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Cartridge Data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Using cartdata(), dset(), and dget(), 64 numbers (256 bytes) of persistent data 
	can be stored on the user's PICO-8 that persists after the cart is unloaded or
	PICO-8 is shutdown. This can be used as a lightweight way to store things like 
	high scores or to save player progress. It can also be used to share data across 
	cartridges / cartridge versions.
	
	If you need more than 256 bytes, it is also possible to write directly to the
	cartridge using cstore(). The disadvantage is that the data is tied to that
	particular version of the cartridge. e.g. if a game is updated, players will
	lose their savegames. Also, some space in the data sections of the cartridge
	need to be left available.
	
	Another alternative is to write directly to a second cartridge by specifying
	a fourth parameter to cstore(). This requires a cart swap (which in reality
	only means the user needs to watch a spinny cart animation for 1 second).
	
		CSTORE(0,0,0x2000, "spritesheet.p8")
		-- later:
		RELOAD(0,0,0x2000, "spritesheet.p8") -- restore the saved data
	

	cartdata id
	
		cartdata() opens a permanent data storage slot indexed by id, that can be
		used to store and retrieve up to 256 bytes (64 numbers) worth of data using 
		DSET() and DGET().
		
			CARTDATA("zep_dark_forest") -- can only be set once per session
			-- later in the program..
			DSET(0, score)
		
		id is a string up to 64 characters long, and should be unusual enough that 
		other cartridges do not accidentally use the same id.
	
		e.g. cartdata("zep_jelpi")
	
		legal characters are a..z, 0..9 and underscore (_)

		returns true if data was loaded, otherwise false

		cartdata can not be called more than once per cartridge execution.
	
		Once a cartdata id has been set, the area of memory 0x5e00..0x5eff is mapped 
		to permanent storage, and can either be accessed directly or via dget/dset.
	
	
	dget index

		Get the number stored at index (0..63)
		Use this only after you have called cartdata()

	dset index value

		Set the number stored at index (0..63)
		Use this only after you have called cartdata()
	
		There is no need to flush written data -- it is automatically
		saved to permanent storage even if POKE()'ed directly.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	GPIO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	GPIO stands for "General Purpose Input Output", and allows machines to comunicate with 
	each other. PICO-8 maps bytes in the range 0x5f80..0x5fff to gpio pins that can be
	poke()ed (to output a value -- e.g. to make an LED light up) or peek()ed (e.g. to read
	the state of a switch).
	
	GPIO means different things for different host platforms:
	
	CHIP:         0x5f80..0x5f87 mapped to xio-p0..xio-p7
	Pocket CHIP:  0x5f82..0x5f87 mapped to GPIO1..GPIO6
		// xio-p0 & p1 are exposed inside the prototyping area inside the case.
	Raspberry Pi: 0x5f80..0x5f8f mapped to wiringPi pins 0..7
		// see http://wiringpi.com/pins/ for mappings on different models
	
	CHIP and Raspberry Pi values are all digital: 0 (LOW) and 255 (HIGH)
	
	Note that to have access to gpio pins, you may need to run pico8 as root: 
	
	sudo pico8
	
	A simple program to blink any LEDs attached on and off:
	
	t = 0
	function _draw()
	 cls(5)
	 for i=0,7 do
	  val = 0
	  if (t % 2 < 1) val = 255
	  poke(0x5f80 + i, val)
	  circfill(20+i*12,64,4,val/11)
	 end
	 t += 0.1
	end
	
	:: HTML
	
	Cartridges exported as HTML / .js use a global array of integers (pico8_gpio) to 
	represent gpio pins. The shell HTML should define the array:
	
	var pico8_gpio = Array(128);


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Mouse and Keyboard Input
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	// experimental! The html implementation is still limited & buggy.

	Mouse and keyboard input can be achieved by enabling devkit input mode:
	
	POKE(0x5F2D, 1)
	
	Note that not every PICO-8 will have a keyboard or mouse attached to it, so when posting
	carts to the Lexaloffle BBS, it is encouraged to make keyboard and/or mouse control 
	optional and off by default, if possible. When devkit input mode is enabled, a message is
	displayed to BBS users warning them that the program is expecting input beyond the 
	standard 6-button controllers.
	
	The state of the mouse and keyboard can be found in stat(x):
	
	STAT(30) -- (Boolean) True when a key
	STAT(31) -- (String) character returned by keyboard
	STAT(32) -- Mouse X
	STAT(33) -- Mouse Y
	STAT(34) -- Mouse buttons (bitfield)
	STAT(36) -- Mouse wheel event


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Additional Lua Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	PICO-8 also exposes 2 features of Lua for advanced users: Metatables and Coroutines.
	
	For more information, please refer to the Lua 5.2 manual.
	
	:: Metatables
	
		Metatables can be used to define the behaviour of objects under particular operations.
		For example, to use tables to represent 2D vectors that can be added together, the 
		'+' operator is redefined by defining an "__add" function for the metatable:
	
			vec2d={
			 __add=function(a,b) 
			 	return {x=(a.x+b.x), y=(a.y+b.y)} 
			 end
			}
		
			v1={x=2,y=9} setmetatable(v1, vec2d)
			v2={x=1,y=5} setmetatable(v2, vec2d)
			v3 = v1+v2
			print(v3.x..","..v3.y) -- 3,14


		setmetatable t, m
	
			set table t metatable to m
		
		getmetatable t
		
			return the current metatable for table t, or nil if none is set
	
	:: Coroutines
	
		Coroutines offer a way to run different parts of a program in a somewhat concurrent 
		way, similar to threads. A function can be called as a coroutine, suspended with 
		yield() any number of times, and then resumed again at the same point.
		
			function hey()
				print("doing something")
				yield()
				print("doing the next thing")
				yield()
				print("finished")
			end
			
			c = cocreate(hey)
			for i=1,3 do coresume(c) end
		
		
		cocreate f
		
			Create a coroutine for function f.
			
		coresume c [p0 p1 ..]
		
			Run or continue the coroutine c. Parameters p0, p1.. are passed to the
			coroutine's function.
			
			Returns true if the coroutine completes without any errors
			Returns false, error_message if there is an error.
			
			** Runtime errors that occur inside coroutines do not cause the program
			to stop running. It is a good idea to wrap coresume() inside an assert().
			If the assert fails, it will print the error message generated by 
			coresume.
			
			assert(coresume(c))


		costatus c
		
			Return the status of coroutine c as a string:
				"running"
				"suspended"
				"dead"
		
		yield
			
			Suspend execution and return to the caller.
